# My professional blog
[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

## What it does
- This blog is powered by R and Quarto and rendered on a subdomain of my portfolio website.
- See also my accompanying [online CV](https://cv.bisacciamd.com) (repo [here](https://github.com/bisacciamd/cv))

## How it works + planned enhancements
- At present, the website is pre-rendered locally, although Github Actions integration for these subdomains is [planned](https://github.com/bisacciamd/cv/issues/3).
