    "text": "On the path toward universal health coverage (UHC), securing adequate funding represents a key contributor to successful implementation (Figure 1). Funding influences the priority setting and breadth of coverage while reflecting the needs of several stakeholders. Various strategies have been proposed to fund healthcare, which fall into two main categories: tax-based and social health insurance (SHI)-based funding. In the present essay, I will 1) compare the design and main features of tax- and SHI-based funding schemes, 2) critically appraise their key differences, and 3) evaluate their performance under the UHC framework, with an emphasis on applied real-world examples of the use of resources, equity, and resilience."

Entitlement\nIn tax-based systems, entitlement is typically universal and defined by law (1), as in the United Kingdom, Canada, or Italy; when universality is not mandated, programs are arranged to provide healthcare financing to certain segments of the population, as happens with the Medicaid program in the United States, or to tackle specific public health issues, as with the National Tuberculosis elimination programme in India.\nIn SHI systems, entitlement is contributory by law, either for all citizens or for certain groups. SHI schemes, however, can achieve accessibility by providing subsidized care, despite evidence of persisting uninsurance in these systems (4). Tax-based systems predictably achieve better accessibility, especially for the poorest and sickest segments of the population."

Additionally, tax abuse or avoidance can threaten the sustainability of these systems, which may be of serious concern in countries with a limited budget for healthcare.\nSHI systems also have their drawbacks. Having employer-sponsored health insurance has been linked to job lock (5), where individuals fear losing their insurance and avoid moving jobs or retiring. SHI is also vulnerable to adverse selection (2), possibly leading to sustainability issues in the long term."

    "text": "3. Insurers\nIn SHI-based countries where multiple agents are at play, higher expenditure is reported. Since providers in these countries operate for profit, they charge more for services, despite providing coverage to fewer people. Additionally, administrative decentralization leads to higher expenditure (6). It follows that SHI countries where a single insurance fund dominates have an administrative expenditure that is comparable to countries where tax revenues are the major financing source (6). When paralleled with SHI systems, due to a simpler organizational structure, tax-based systems have historically achieved reduced healthcare expenditure and waste (6).\nWasteful expenditure due to poor implementation of the priority setting and inefficient administration amounts to ~20% of the healthcare budget in OECD countries, and up to 40% in developing countries (7); among OECD countries, SHI systems waste significantly more (6). As a result, SHI-based countries have larger healthcare expenditures, but their population does not benefit in terms of overall health and lifespan (8) . Among OECD countries, eight countries achieve high life expectancy while keeping health expenditure comparably low (9) . In six of these (Spain, Italy, Israel, Portugal, Chile, and Costa Rica), healthcare is funded majorly by tax revenue. The remaining two countries (Korea and Slovenia) use mixed funding sources of SHI and tax revenue, possibly hinting that even running a government-based scheme in parallel to an SHI scheme may help to reduce healthcare expenditure without sacrificing outcome."

    "text": "4. Management\nAs money is collected through public revenue in tax-financed systems, these countries face almost incessant political debate on healthcare spending. This is the case in countries like Italy (10,11) and the UK (12,13), where political decisions such as increased decentralization and Brexit affected healthcare system performance in the last decade, particularly by hampering workforce planning; this is often tackled by hiring agency workers at the expense of quality of care and reliability (11,14,15). Tax-funded schemes in Europe have also been criticized for their inert bureaucracy (16) that appears resistant to the «information revolution» and has caused delays in the adoption of novel technologies and services. However, the political discourse around healthcare has also demonstrated the potential to improve public participation; in Thailand, where three-quarters of the population receive UHC through a tax-based fund (1), participatory governance through consistent citizen involvement led to improved access to quality care (17)."

    "text": "5. Providers\nIn tax-based systems, little competition is present between providers (2), which may be seen as a disadvantage over SHI-funded schemes, where the regulations on competition may allow for widespread, affordable coverage. However, there is evidence that aiming for increased competition may affect population health in unexpected ways. In 1991, the UK NHS was the subject of a reform aimed at increasing provider efficiency, the «NHS internal market». In this system, hospitals were encouraged to reduce waiting times and overall price-for-service. This was later shown to have a detrimental effect on the health outcomes of patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction (18). Quasi-private reforms are thus seen as ineffective and reduced competition may be seen as a structural feature of tax-based systems."

Rationing\nIn tax-based systems, staff or resource shortages introduce queues, which are seen negatively by the general public and may consequently take a central stage in the country’s political debate. Additionally, queues are shown to exacerbate existing socioeconomic inequalities by rendering healthcare less accessible to the poor and sickest (19). On the other hand, in SHI-based countries, queues are not a major issue, and health policy aims to control the larger healthcare spending. To do so, price schedules are utilized, although these may produce clinical distortions by inducing or aggravating a prominence effect (20) on physicians."

    "text": "1. Cost-effectiveness\nUHC promotes efficient use of resources through the exclusion of ineffective services and expansion of high-value care, in an effort to maintain healthcare expenditure at a sustainable level. Evidence from low- and middle-income countries (25) shows that healthcare funding based on tax revenue is a major determinant of UHC progress. This finding was later confirmed in OECD countries, where the promotion of cost-effective services – and, consequently, progress towards UHC – depends largely on the underlying funding scheme, even after accounting for a country’s gross domestic product and socioeconomic gaps, a retrospective analysis showed (26).\nBy observing OECD countries transitioning from a tax- to an SHI-based system, A. Wagstaff demonstrated that the adoption of an SHI scheme increased health expenditure by as much as 4% (3) (Figure 4); increased expenditure not only did not reduce attributable mortality but came at the cost of reduced employment rates – by up to 10% in the healthcare sector. This builds on the concept that employers might be discouraged from hiring new workers in SHI-funded systems. Another important point regarding the cost-effectiveness of healthcare systems is effective resource utilization. As previously pointed out, health expenditure is wasted more in OECD countries with an SHI scheme in place (6), in relation to the multiplicity of providers offering similar services in a decentralized fashion and at greater administrative costs (7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Outcomes in OECD countries transitioning from tax-based to SHI-based schemes.

    "text": "2. Health equity\nUHC mandates a primary focus of healthcare systems on the disadvantaged, poor, and rural segments of the population, as these are most likely to benefit from improved access. SHI schemes, however, prioritize coverage for formal workers, to later expand to informal workers and the unemployed; thus, SHI schemes are in open contrast with UHC’s equity principle (21). SHI-based schemes are also affected by adverse selection, whereas risk adjustment strategies are detrimental to the sickest by overestimating their risk of future disease (27).\nOn the other hand, tax-based schemes are not free from threats to equity. In a resource-constrained healthcare system, queueing as a consequence of rationing should not affect patients with severe diseases or urgent presentation. Instead, socioeconomic inequalities in access to care were observed in the Italian national health service (19), so longer waiting times would be experienced by those with reduced ability to pay."

Financial protection\nDespite significant advances in the previous 20 years, rates of catastrophic health spending are now increasing worldwide as progress toward UHC has halted since 2015 (28). A systematic review of evidence from 133 countries showed that SHI funding was a significant predictor of increased catastrophic spending (29). The authors concluded that to reduce out-of-pocket pay, countries should increase prepayments, especially channeled through taxes and mandatory contributions. Low financial protection has an interplay with reduced health equity, as 100 million people worldwide are pushed into extreme poverty each year, facing poorer health outcomes as a result (7)."

    "text": "Resilience\nThe 2008 global financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have affected healthcare systems worldwide (9,30). Under stressful circumstances, resilient health systems maintain performance and prevent individual financial hardship while minimizing service disruptions and system costs. This is achieved through preparedness and dynamic adaptation (31). In comparison with pre-pandemic years, government-based schemes in OECD countries increased healthcare expenditure by an average of 26% per year in 2019-2021 (9). Spending growth was greater in countries with SHI (9), possibly because in these countries, governments with limited purchasing roles in healthcare had to shoulder significant responsibilities during the pandemic.\nEven SHI-based countries with apparently strong healthcare systems were less resilient during the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic (32). This resulted from more fluctuating, economy-dependent service coverage, which mostly affected the poorer segments of society – again, in contrast with the UHC principle to protect the poor and sickest. As a result, these countries have suffered greater social pressure, morbidity, and mortality (31). However, it should be noted that funding is only one of several determinants of health system resilience (33), which also include effective governance, health service delivery, workforce, public health function, and technologies, along with achieving community engagement."

In an analysis of 133 countries, catastrophic spending occurred more frequently in SHI-based systems than in tax-based systems, despite increased health expenditure in the former (29). The authors stated that to protect people from catastrophic out-of-pocket payments, what is needed is to increase «the share of total health expenditure that is prepaid», especially «through taxes and mandatory contributions». In other words, to shift towards tax-funded health systems would lead to broader coverage and better population health (24)."
